A modification of the Voron Design exhaust filter housing and filter grill to allow for running a CAN umbilical up the back of the printer. Grill is M12x1.5 thread.

Install parts as stock, except for a gasket of VHB between the umbilical "tunnel" and grill if you want a better seal if you're using a VEFACH. You can also use a grommet around the umbilical exit to further seal the chamber if you want.
