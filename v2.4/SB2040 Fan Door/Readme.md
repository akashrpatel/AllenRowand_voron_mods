A modification of the Stealthburner PCB cover door to add a cooling fan. I used one for the E3D Revo Micro, 20mm x 10mm, 5v.

Versions:

– SB2040 door with capacitor relief NO FAN v2 provides clearance for the capacitor at the top of the board but is otherwise stock.

– SB2040 door with capacitor relief and fan v10 adds a lower profile mount for the cooling fan.

– SB2040 Fan Door v1 adds the cooling fan but is not clearanced for the capacitor, this will be removed as soon as v10 is confirmed good.

Thanks to garbqgebag V2.1135 V0.610 on the VoronDesign Discord for early testing.
