A modification of the Stealthburner PCB cover door to add a cooling fan. I used one for the E3D Revo Micro, 20mm x 10mm, 5v.

Pre-fan, the SB2040 went over 90ºC printing this door. With the fan it maxed at 68ºC printing the same file.

The fan should be oriented to blow on the board, you'll need to remove the wires from the strain relief.

Versions:

– SB2040 door with capacitor relief NO FAN v2 provides clearance for the capacitor at the top of the board but is otherwise stock.

– SB2040 door with capacitor relief and fan mount for the cooling fan.

Thanks to garbqgebag V2.1135 V0.610 on the VoronDesign Discord for early testing.
